# Hand Gesture Recognition System
# Aim
Develop a system that recognizes hand gestures from a video stream or camera feed, enabling potential applications such as controlling devices or interacting with virtual environments.

# Description
This project uses deep learning techniques to train a model capable of recognizing various hand gestures. The system processes input from a video stream or camera feed in real-time and classifies the gestures, which can be used for controlling devices, interacting with virtual environments, or other applications in human-computer interaction.

# Technologies Used

Python: The primary programming language used for this project.
OpenCV: For video capture, image processing, and real-time video stream handling.
TensorFlow/Keras: Used to build and train the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for gesture recognition.
Mediapipe: A framework by Google for building multimodal (video, audio, etc.) machine learning pipelines, used here for hand tracking and landmark detection.

# What You Will Learn

Computer Vision: Techniques for processing and analyzing images and videos to extract meaningful information.
Video Processing: Handling real-time video streams and processing each frame to extract and analyze features.
Keras/TensorFlow: Building, training, and deploying neural networks, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks.
Hand Gesture Recognition: Developing systems that can interpret and classify hand gestures from visual input.
